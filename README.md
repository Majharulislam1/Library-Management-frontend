# Library Management Frontend üìö

## Project Overview

This is a simple library management system built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)**, and **TypeScript**. The system allows users to:

- View a list of books.
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books.
- Borrow books.
- View a borrow summary.

The project is designed to be minimal, focusing on essential functionalities without authentication, category filters, or payment integration.

## Features

### 1. Public Routes üöÄ
- All pages are publicly accessible without login or authentication.
- Focus is on essential book and borrowing features.

### 2. Book Management üõ†Ô∏è

- **Book List Table:**
  - Displays a list of all books.
  - Columns: Title, Author, Genre, ISBN, Copies, Availability, Actions.
  
- **Action Buttons/Icons:**
  - **Edit Book**: Opens a form to edit an existing book's details.
  - **Delete Book**: Confirms deletion of a book.
  - **Borrow Book**: Opens a form to borrow a book (check availability).
  - **Add New Book**: Opens a form to add a new book with fields like Title, Author, Genre, ISBN, Description, Copies, Available.
  
- **Business Logic:**
  - If copies of a book are set to 0, the book is marked as unavailable.
  - Borrowing a book reduces the available copies.
  
### 3. Borrow Book

- **Borrow Form**:
  - Opens from the ‚ÄúBorrow‚Äù button in the book list.
  - Fields: Quantity (number), Due Date (date).
  
- **Business Logic:**
  - The quantity cannot exceed available copies.
  - If copies reach 0, the book will be marked as unavailable.
  
- After borrowing a book, a success message is displayed and the user is redirected to the **Borrow Summary** page.

### 4. Borrow Summary

- Displays a summary of borrowed books.
- Columns: Book Title, ISBN, Total Quantity Borrowed.
- Aggregated data is retrieved from an API.
